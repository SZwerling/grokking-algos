THE CALL STACK
Any time a function is invoked it is placed (pushed) on top of the call stack.
When JS sees the return keyword or when the function ends, the compiler will
remove (pop).

Often used in JSON.parse


TWO ESSENTIAL PARTS:
Base case. So it has a place to stop.
New input/Changing input. Obviously you don't want to call it on the same piece of data again and again.
